PROBLEM SET 2:
ALTER TABLE Adopters 
ADD COLUMN adoption_date NUMBER

ALTER TABLE Pets 
ADD COLUMN has_vaccinations BOOLEAN VARCHAR(50);

ALTER TABLE Adopters 
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_email
UNIQUE (email);

REFLECTION:
The unique constraint on the email column ensures no two adopters share the same email, preventing duplicates and confusion.
This enhances data accuracy and usability, allowing for reliable communication and efficient management of adopter records,
ultimately fostering trust in the adoption process.
