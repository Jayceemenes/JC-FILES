PROBLEM SET 3:
ORA-00001: unique constraint (SQL_RXZURTOUCPVTMERCVXFAEUIVL.SYS_C00173190579)
violated ORA-06512: at "SYS.DBMS_SQL", line 1721

REFLECTION:
This error indicates a duplicate entry for the email column, violating the unique constraint. 
Unique constraints ensure all values are distinct, and the database enforces this during inserts and updates. 
In the pet adoption scenario, this prevents confusion and maintains accurate records, fostering trust and efficiency.
